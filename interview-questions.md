Your answer: When I think of JSX I think of react, it is part of the react js library and it is a combo of HTML and Javascript functionality that will dynamically work together with components that will render on a single page application. JSX uses class object components and can me called with <ClassComponent />, HTML does not have any js functionality and the syntax for most html tags will have a two <> </> an open and closing tag. For example <div> </div> <h1></h1>

With a couple commands in the terminal you get started on coding a new app and quickly see the changes live on localhost 3000. When you run yarn it allow thr user to test the app and will automacticly display any errors and will keep listening to all the changes that are made to the app. I know that once you run yarn in the teminal, it will allow you to run local host on the browser, and some files are add to the folder. Im not sure which files are modded.


Researched answer: Similar to npm yarn is a javascript package manager, the purpose is to make installing easy and organized. When you run yarn you will get a lot of default dependencies and a store in the node_modules folder, and will automatially resolve/ update any packages that need to be updated or downloaded and then stored in the node_modules directory.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: (OOP) programming paradign that relie on concept of class and object

2. Ruby: A dynamuc open source language for simplicity and productivity. It is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection  and just in time compilation

3. Implicit return: when using arrow function you can have implicit return which means it will do everything in one line of code.

4. Ruby blocks:similar to an method, but does not belong to an object, they are called closures in other languages. Blocks can accept argument and returns a value, doesnt have thier own name, is always invoked with a function.

5. Ruby hashes: Collection of key value pairs, doesnt not have numerical indexes , only access the values with the keys
